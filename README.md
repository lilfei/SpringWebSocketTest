# SpringWebSocketTest
springmvc websocket mqtt

> **Note:** Just for test

###WebSocket
Just start server and use websocket.html for test the Websocket

###MQTT
First you need a mqtt server(Just like: [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/download.html))
You need download it or others,and start the mqtt server;

Then you can use the Publisher.java or Subscriber.java to test it. 

Or http://localhost:8080/SpringWebSocketTest/ then input topic: "toclient/124" and into message what you want

Gook Luck!
